    <div class="content-intro"><p>Three Space Lab (3SL) is an early-stage MIT Media Lab spin-off company working on mixed reality software solutions for team collaboration and learning. The current portfolio of projects is divided between these two areas, while sharing a common infrastructure across all of them. On the education side, we make tools and content for middle school, high school, and university-level learning, with an emphasis on STEM. Our approach is centered around interactive spatial visualization and simulation. On the team collaboration side, we are building a product that we plan to release in summer of 2022. Past company projects have focused on electricity and magnetism, crystal structures, 3D scanning, and tools for collaborative visual design.</p>
<p><em>We are math and physics geeks with an artsy side (dance, drawing, music), and we welcome people of any gender, race, ethnicity, color, ability, class, religion, culture, or nationality. We believe that working with people who have diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds enhances our ideas, enriches our lives as individuals and as a team, and is invaluable for understanding how we can best have a positive impact.</em></p></div>

              Looking into college brochures, I found ~industrial design^ and
              thought: here*s a major that merges technology and Art and could
              be a good compromise between me and my parental units.
