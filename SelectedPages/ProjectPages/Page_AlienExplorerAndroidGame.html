I am fascinated by random generation. I think that at the core, the simplest player vs computer game can be boiled down to one bit: pc randomly sets the bit HIGH or LOW, the player wins if they can guess the value of the bit. The fun comes from not knowing the decisions of the computer. I started recreating a 2d fan made version of Noman*s sky concept. I designed this top-down game to creating the illusion of navigating a super large map while adhering to low end mobile phones storage limitations. Map building: By storing a minimal amount of map data in a list and constantly removing the furthest areas of the map, I can create a seemingly infinite map of randomly generated persistent planets. Game play mechanics: The player controls a spaceship* yaw and throttle to move around. The frictionless attribute of deep space is taken into account, making the ship drift in the direction of its propulsion. Planets exert a gravitational pull on the ship. Larger planets have more gravity. The player must maneuver the ship to land safely. Once landed, the player can walk around the planet to collect alien creatures. There was going to be a fuel management system, and random alien generator, but then No Man Sky was delivered at my door, and I got side tracked.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
