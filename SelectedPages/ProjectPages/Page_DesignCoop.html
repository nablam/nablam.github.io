I interned at a locale design firm, and was working on various graphic design projects. It was a very fast passed environment. The team was small and the contracts were enormous! All in all, it was a great time. My boss was French designer living in a fancy downtown Boston apartment, which also served as a design studio. I was the youngest recruit, and since I also was a technology enthusiast, I was given the task of IT related issues on top of my graphic design tasks. I put together the office website, an it looks like it hasn*t changed since one of the projects was to create an orientation table, and I happen to walk by it while visiting New York years after its installation.  Orientation table in Battery Park NY.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
