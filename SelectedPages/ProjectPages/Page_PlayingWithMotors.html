I was a fan of the DIY electronic experiments. They provided schematics and explanations for building gadgets like a traffic signal, buzzers and Christmas tree light strobe.  I added resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors to my list of scavenged parts. My Lego creations were upgraded with blinking lights, motors. Moving to a new school, I found the only other kid who like me enjoyed electronics. His dad was and electrical engineer and had a home shop stacked with equipment, schematics, and tons of cool stuff. My friend and I build a remote control from scratch (blindly following a schematic) and since I was the one with the Lego, I also build a chassis. We were now the only kids in town with a remote-controlled car.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
