One of if not the first programming center in my town for adults. Once again, my dad*s buddy was the program administrator, and I was allowed to attend the course. Thinking back as I am writing this blog, I was rather privileged as a child and didn*t even know it. I remember going in early to be able to use the IBMs to play a few minutes of Price or Persia, the goonies, and river run before the class started. This was the only other place where I had access to playing a real video game. Sure, there were coffee places in town that had arcades, there even was an actual arcade venue stacked with dozens of cabinets, but these were not places I was allowed to go. They were primarily frequented by delinquents and other types of folks that my parents would try to keep me away from. I did manage to sneak in a few times, and my parents were right. Illegal gambling was rampant, and often a video game contest would turn into a real knife fight and full-on brawls in the venues.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
