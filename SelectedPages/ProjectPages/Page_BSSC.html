I was living in Algeria, but my parents regularly traveled to France for winter vacations. I didn*t do any winter activities between 96 and 04, when I met Mark M. A college dorm mate who needed a riding buddy. He had a spare snowboard and boots, and asked me if I rodeâ€¦ to which I answered with no hesitation: yes. On the road to Attitash Me, I remember thinking to myself: How long can I *ride* this lie? (Pun very much intended). The answer was: as soon as I have to get off the chairlift. After taking a stereotypical chairlift spill, I had to confess. Mark M. told me that he knew it was going to be a long day the moment he watched unload the boards from the car. I was riding almost every weekend, and every winter from then on. This is obviously is not a cheap hobby, and a broke college student has to find ways around this issue.  Some more legal than others. One of the sustainable legal solutions was to become a ski bus guide. I joined the Boston Ski and Sports Club, and soon became a weekend day trip chaperone. We would start the day at 5:30 am loading the bus, then sleep on the way up north. I could ride all day for free! In 2012 I was upgraded to weekend chaperone. I met Julie on my first weekend trip and we have been inseparable since then.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
