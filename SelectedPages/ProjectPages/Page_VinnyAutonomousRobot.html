I had need building small circuits using a single sessor, but most of the work was a replication of some tutorial. Vinny was the first complete microcontroller project. Vinny is an autonomous object avoiding Lego rover. I built the chassis using two Lego motors and Lego tank treads. Each motor drives a tread and the whole thing maneuvers like a tank would: when both treads cycle in the same direction, the rover will advance in the same direction. When treads cycle in opposite direction, the rover turns. The rover is equipped with three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. One is positioned facing the front of the rover, and the other two are placed on the front corners at a 45-degree angle. The code is pretty straight forward: - a sensor emits an ultrasonic wave every T time periods, and starts a timer.-If a signal is received within the T period, the timer is read - and a distance to obstacle is calculated - the same process is run on all three sensors - the result distance readings are stored in an array for analysis. Analysis and locomotion:This is solved with a simple switch case loop-While the front distance is null (no obstacle was detected) keep moving forward-If front distance falls below a threshold change state to obstacle Detected  - Then compare the side distances-Start with sensor on the right (totally arbitrary but I decided Vinny was a righty) -If right distance is null, then turn right  -Else turn left</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
