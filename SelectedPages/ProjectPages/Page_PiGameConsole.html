Basically, I wanted to have my kids play games that I create in unity. I didn*t want they*re too young to use the computer and I would rather use something more durable listless expensive period a perfect solution so now the challenge is putting a unity game which runs on X86 based processor with a Raspberry Pi which is an arm ship period. I also wanted to create a custom-made controllers using an Arduino because I wanted to have analogue sliders since the first idea was to create pong. I tried the WebGL round which was very easy to deploy but suffers from a very small browser memory allocation period.  anything more complex that simple blocks and very small number of branded watches will not run with the current state of WebAssembly. One workaround is to edit the JSON settings file and increase the value for TOTAL_MEMORY. The WebGl people advise using 512Md. The max allowed is only 2024 and is not recommended at all. Another option to explore will be Unity Project tiny. At the moment It may not support. The goal is to build a cheap game console than can run my own unity games with my custom controllers for my kids (3 and 5) Idea: raspberry pi , Arduino controllers , custom unity games. I figured the first games would be pong and some variation of pong. I could just build the game in python and look for ways to either use the GPIO for connecting custom game controllers. The know the pi has around 40 pins, and although some are restricted, I could still have enough for 2 standard game controllers D-pad=4 buttons=4 start/select=2 LR=2 so 28 pins for two players. I still want to use a linear slider for pong and others games that could be fun to play with an analogue controller.  Optimally, I would like to have a standard controller and a linear slider. The pi does not have analogue inputs. I could use an external 14bit ADC but at this point I*m not sold on building python games. I know that in the future, the clients will be older and would want more graphically advanced games. I do know Unity pretty well, so I decided to make it a req.  Investigate ways to run unity games on pi hardware. It would be nice to have the unity editor running right on the pi. Unity editor could run on windows10 IOT … buuut. it would be unusable even with an 8gb ram. The pi has an ARM processor so there will be lots of overhead running the OS in the first place on top of unity editor … no way. It looks like I should definitely build the games on pc and then deploy them to the pi. Looking into widws10 IOT, I found that running the games only will be sluggish.  What other option do I have?  I could just run Raspbian OS and I could even have Godot game editor on it, but I*m not comfortable enough with it. Using unity, I can always build custom C  software, I*m just more comfortable with unity.  Another option would be using x86 wrapper. Back to using Raspbian: I can build WebGL games and run them in browser. Test results: can only handle 256mb games … boo. It does run like a charm on Chrome OS though. I will get back to investigating this approach as WebGL gets updated. Unity-Tiny is also something to look into. Final solution: Build game pc for Android. Make HID controllers with Arduino Leonardo. Run game on Lineage OS on pi.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
