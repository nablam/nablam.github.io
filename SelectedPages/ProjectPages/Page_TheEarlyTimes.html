Toy stores were not the priority for developing countries at that time, but since my family traveled often to France for winter vacations, I was able to get Lego sets. I had to be creative and build the toys I wanted. Many times, I had to disassemble my favorite current toy in order to build a new one. I spent most vacation days drawing, building toys, or watching tv. I grew up in a house where video games were almost taboo for some weird reason. One day I was in a hotel bar/restaurant with my parents, and noticed an Arcade machine. There was a definite look of panic in their eyes saying ~oh no this is not for you, but it*s too late since you*ve seen one already^. I had already run to the machine, and it was glorious. I don*t remember what game was playing, there were so many colors and works and animations. My parents convinced me that I didn*t need coins to play. I was allowed to move the joysticks and click the buttons pretending I was really playing.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
