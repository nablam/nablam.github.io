PUBG on pc was inaccessible, either because of too many hackers, or kids were just that good. Anyway, I found that PUBG was also available on mobile. At least on mobile, everyone was subject to the same clunky controls. The playing field was leveled, peripheral extensions were prohibited. I was getting pretty comfortable with PUBG mobile and was losing interest. A new weapon was introduced in the game. This weapon required a perfect shooting timing in order to maximize its firing rate. Example firing rate. The weapon is powerful, but mastering the timing was very hard. What if I build a device that could automate the firing? Such device could not be connected to the host or it would be detected, and my account would be banned. I looked at how capacitive screen work and realized I could replicate a human touch by placing a probe on the screen and grounding it to simulate a touch. I experimented with a few materials: touch pen rubber cap, aluminum pads, and copper pads. I could also bunch the probes in array formations since the PUBG UI settings allowed button placements.  I used an Arduino uno and relays to create multiple switches. I then programmed a few routines including the auto fire mode. Final Example.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
