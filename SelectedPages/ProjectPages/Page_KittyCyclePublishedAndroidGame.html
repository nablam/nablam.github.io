Yeah, I*ve been the center of many jokes for being a cs student while still rocking a dumb phone. My answer has always been that I didn*t need a smart phone yet. I remember the time I use to dump into programming a TI83, and that I should not get distracted by mobile development while still in school.  Now I got a sweet pocket computer with internet access on the go! I could even install a light IDE and code for fun while commuting to work on the train. I was firmware believer â€¦ I mean, a firm believer in owning one*s hardware, and I would systematically root my phones, clear the bloat-ware, and sleep with a smile on my face knowing that my smart phone belongs to me (provided I don*t use the SIM and stay on my own network) . I start exploring Android development. Unity has an easy Android build deployment system, so I figured I would start there before playing with native development. I wanted to build an Android game and publish it to the play store. I already had a rigged cat model (Pasha) and started making a few animations for a simple scrolling game featuring a kat on a unicycle jumping hurdles of random heights and collecting points. (update 2022:  this game is no longer available, or I just can*t find it anymore )</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
