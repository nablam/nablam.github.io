That was strange since they both have a cell phone and have not used the land line in years. It was my dad. He seemed panicked saying ~I called amazon*s customer service with my cell phone, and now this tech guy is moving the cursor on his laptop, and is opening weird black screens with white text^. Oh boyâ€¦ I told him to immediately power off the laptop. I knew that somehow, he got owned. Now I have to investigate ad do some damage control.  Later that week I went to my parents* house to pick up the laptop and get the full story.  My dad said that he had some issues with his monochrome Amazon KindleV1, and the kindle provided a link to amazon*s customer service. He entered the said link on his laptop*s browser, and found ~an^ Amazon customer care site that provided a phone number to call. After calling this number, he was linked to an ~Amazon^ customer service tech who asked him to download some software and follow prompts for install. After that, the tech guy went silent on the phone and started digging around on my dad*s laptop, and that*s when he called me. Investigation stage:  preparation: Id, story, vm, and network First contact: Change strategy Final call:</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
