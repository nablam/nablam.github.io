In fact, one of my oldest memories are from a drawing session in kindergarten. We were drawing a tennis scene, and I remember getting upset when my teacher asked me to draw the court as a rectangle like everyone else instead of a trapezoid. I was trying to draw in perspective but could verbalize it. The teacher kept saying that tennis courts are rectangles, and could not explain that side lines should taper toward a focal point. (I wish I could have said it this way back thenâ€¦). My drawing abilities were more advanced than my peers, and so I would always be asked to draw my friends* favorite cartoon characters, which I gladly did as they were also my favorites. I had drawn two 25page ninja turtle comic books, and was crating mini flip books by drawing animated stick figures in the corners of all my school books. I was experimenting with motion, and visual language without even knowing it. I would make animations of a heavy stick figure running sluggishly, and contrast that with a thin fit stick figure lightly striding. I was also fascinated by destruction. I would take many days creating flip book animations of intricate structures and buildings collapsing with every detail of blocks and rebar falling and crumbling. Ironically, all this work was lost in the rubbles of an actual earth quake in 1997.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
