At the time it seemed like a logical decision. I was thinking about getting into the business side of things, and maybe start a design firm someday. My buddy Doug was interested in real estate and was studying for the GMATs so I tagged along study sessions with him and passed the test. The real test was finding a true interest in business. I learned that business is none of my business lol. I remember going to class, taking notes, and dealing with trivial business math. I studied what was necessary for passing tests and that was it. I never felt the drive and curiosity to dive deeper in the concepts learned in class. The passion was clearly missing.</p> <br><h4></h4></div> </section> </div> <footer id="footer"> <div class="inner"> <ul class="icons"> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/usergroupX" class="icon brands alt fa-youtube"><span class="label">Youtube</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nablam/" class="icon brands alt fa-linkedin-in"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/nablam" class="icon brands alt fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> </li> </ul> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; NabDev</li>  </ul> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/rawtextLoader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/CryptoJSgoogz.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/Obfuscation.js"></script> </body> </html>
