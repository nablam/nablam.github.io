                given a leap motion device to incorporate in a game. Our game

                My dad was very well connected back then. He personally knew a
                few university professors and presidents, and I was able to
                attend the local after school university*s electronics design
                class at a young age. It was fun playing with multimeters and

                My parents had a subscription to ~sciences et vie^ a monthly
                French science magazine which was one of the few foreign
                subscriptions allowed in Algeria at the time. I was a fan of the
                DIY electronic experiments. They provided schematics and explan

                I was reaching the limits of what was possible to create with a
                limited Lego set. I started experimenting with fusing Lego with
                cardboard extensions. One day I opened a broken Walkman with the
                idea of pulling out the motor and integrate it to my ...

                North Africa in the 90*s was pretty good but not stellar. Toy
                stores were not the priority for developing countries at that
                time, but since my family traveled often to France for winter
                vacations, I was able to get Lego sets. I had to be creative ...
