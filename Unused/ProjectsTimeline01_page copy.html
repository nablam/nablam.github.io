                  server that would be holding my camera. when the color move
                  their heads left or right my camera will also represent that
                  motion giving them the impression that they are looking
                  through a an actual window.. I worked on it for a week and it

                  I wanted a way to put my Unity games on a console for my kids.
                  Basically I wanted to have my kids play games that I create in
                  annuity period I didn't want they're too young to use the
                  computer and I would rather use something more durable
                  listless expensive period a perfect solution so now the
                  challenge is putting a unity game which runs on X86 based
                  processor with a Raspberry Pi which is an arm ship period. I
                  also wanted to create a custom made controllers using an
                  Arduino because I wanted to have analogue sliders since the
                  first idea was to create pong. I tried the webgl round which
                  was very quite to deploy but suffers from a very small browser
                  memory allocation period. anything more complex that simple
                  blocks and very small number of branded watches will not run
                  with the current WebGL state. One workaround is to edit the
                  .json file and increase the value for TOTAL_MEMORY. The webGl
                  peopl advise using 512Md. The max allowed is only 2024 and is
                  not recommended at all. Another option to explore will be

                  Another fun weekend project is the mail detector equipped with
                  a microphone that says you've got mail just like in the good
                  old AOL days. When the mail man slips an envelope through the
                  mail slot on the front door, it passes in front of a sensor
                  which triggers an Arduino uno to play the original wave audio
                  “You got mail” The wave file was converted to raw bytes and
                  stored directly on the EEPROM. I then built simple audio
                  amplifier using a standard OpAmp.

                  Early 2020 When zoom started to become part of our life, I
                  thought it would be nice to include the other party’s face in
                  my video feed. I created a quick project using OpenCV to
                  detect a face anywhere on the screen, then compose it on a 3D
                  object in Unity, then feed that back into any video

                  I got a 3d printer<br />
                  3D printing a collection of 3D printing tricks and tips that I
                  have learned well designing various little object with my new
                  3D printer. I acquired my first 3D printer at the beginning of
                  the covid. I figured I would be home for an extended period of
                  time, and it would be a perfect time to get into 3D printing.
                  One of my friends is a professional in additive manufacturing
                  and he suggested trying the Creality Ender5 as a solid entry
                  level printer. After getting comfortable with it I started
                  upgrading : I accidentally snapped the mini usb plug and had
                  to solder it back on. I accidentally snapped it later , and
                  this time it was unsalvageable. I decided to upgrade the bord
                  to a 32bit processor board. This can support marlin 2.0 and
                  extra peripheral devices such as and automatic bed leveler.
                  Upgraded the file transfer and printer monitoring. I had a
                  spare raspberry pi laying around and used it to run Octoprint.
                  I use Fusion 360 to design mechanical parts, and blender to
                  design more organic forms . I’ve used both Cura and

                  A friend of mine I brainstormed an idea to build a math game
                  for kids. We came up with the bellhop bunny after Consulting
                  with our kids. This hotel is made of multiple floors has a
                  stack on each floor is a little critter who needs to provide
                  an item to a friend who lives on a different floor the way to
                  access the different floor his to solve an easy addition
                  problem. Each floor is randomly generated and the characters
                  on the right of my generated floors follow a unique procedural
                  animation. for example if the the animal lives in a room the
                  room will be furnished with a random bed a bedside table a rug
                  and items you can find in the bedroom and arrange them in a
                  random order while leaving enough space for the Critter to
                  walk to the front door. When the doors open with see the
                  critter doing an action that would be generally associated
                  with a broom such as getting up from the bed and walking to
                  the door or getting up from their desk and walking to the

                  I don’t remember how i got introduced to OpenFx. It was
                  certainly not a product of an internet search. I was running
                  Windows98 and AOL, Netscape and InternetExplorer were all the
                  rage. OpenFx is a very clunky mesh editor compared other
                  modeling software at the time, but it was FreeWare.

                  Introduced to GW basic at a local “informatic center”. One of

                  again, my dad’s buddy was the program administrator, and I was
                  allowed to attend the course. Thinking back as I am writing
                  this blog, I was rather privileged as a child and didn’t even
                  know it. I remember going in early to be able to use the IBMs
                  to play a few minutes of Price or persia , the goonies, and
                  river run before the class started.

                  My dad was very well connected back then. He personally knew a
                  few university professors and presidents, and I was able to
                  attend the local after school university’s electronics design
                  class at a young age. It was fun playing with multimeters and
                  sciloscopes, and have access to a plethora of components, but
                  I remember feeling blank, dark,and confused when the topics
                  evolved to digital circuits and high math analysis. It almost
                  felt like the stress felt when youre not ready for an exam,
                  except I was not a registered student. I would still take
                  notes knowing that some day I would be a grownup and
                  understand it.

                  My parents had a subscription to “sciences et vie” a monthly
                  french science magazine which was one of the few foreign
                  subsciptios allowed in Algeria at the time. I was a fan of the
                  DIY electronic experiments. They provided schematics and
                  explanations for building gadgets like a traffic signal ,
                  buzers and christmas tree light strobe. I added resistors ,
                  capacitors, diods and transistors to my list of scavanged
                  parts. My lego creations were upgraded with blinking lights,
                  motors. Moving to a new school, I found the only other kid who
                  like me enjoyed electronics. His dad was and electrical
                  engineer and had a home shop stacked with equipment,
                  schematics , and tons of cool stuff. My friend and I build a
                  remote controle from scratch (blindly following a schematic)
                  and since I was the one with the lego, I also build a chassis
                  . We were now the only kids in town with a remote controlled
                  car.

                  Discovering electricity. I was reaching the limits of what was
                  possible to create with a limited lego set. I started
                  experimenting with fusing lego with cardboard extentions. One
                  day I opened broken walkman with the idea of pulling out the
                  motor and integrate it to my lego. I built a lego plane with a
                  motorized propeller. I would hold the plane with my fingers
                  and connect two exposed wires and the propeller wold spin. I
                  was hooked. I started scavenging basic components like motors,
                  light bulbs, and wires from any juck I could get my hands on.

                  North Africa in the 90’s was pretty good but not stellar. Toy
                  stores were not the priority for developing countries at that
                  time, but since my family traveled often to France, I was able
                  to get lego sets. I had to be creative and build the toys I
                  wanted. Many times had to disassemble my favorit current toy
                  in order to build a new one. I spent most vacation days
                  drawing, building toys, or watching tv. I grew up in a house
                  where video games were almost taboo for some weird reason. Ond
                  day I was in a hotel bar/restaurant with my parents, and
                  noticed an Arcade machine. There was a definit look of panic
                  in their eyes saying “oh no this is not for you, but it’s too
                  late since you’ve seen on”. I had already ran to the machine ,
                  and it was glorious. I don’t remember what game it was , there
                  were so many colors and works and animations. My parents
                  convinced me that I didn’t need coins to play. I was allowed
                  to move the joysticks and click the buttons pretending i was
                  playing.
